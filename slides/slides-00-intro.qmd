## Learning goals of the workshop {.smaller}
\

- The primary learning goal of the workshop is to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of machine learning and its various types. This knowledge will help you determine which type of machine learning, or whether a non-machine learning approach, would be most appropriate for your problem.


## Agenda
- We will have four modules in the workshop
  - Module 1: Introduction 
  - Module 2: Machine learning fundamentals 
  - Module 3: Commonly used machine learning models 
  - Module 4: Introduction to deep learning
  - Module 5: Using pre-trained models and embeddings to get things done
- Most modules will include hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.
- We'll also make sure to take some breaks in between sessions. 

## Source of the website 
- We are using Quarto to create slides, with live code running in the background. You can access the source for this website and our slides on this GitHub page [https://github.com/kvarada/FoS-Intro-to-ML-2025](https://github.com/kvarada/FoS-Intro-to-ML-2025)

# Let's get started! Buckle up and enjoy the ride!
