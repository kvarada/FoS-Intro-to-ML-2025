This knowledge will help you determine which type of machine learning, or whether a non-machine learning approach, would be most appropriate for your problem.\n\n\n## Agenda\n- We will have four modules in the workshop\n  - Module 1: Introduction \n  - Module 2: Machine learning fundamentals \n  - Module 3: Commonly used machine learning models \n  - Module 4: Introduction to deep learning\n  - Module 5: Using pre-trained models and embeddings to get things done\n- Most modules will include hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.\n- We'll also make sure to take some breaks in between sessions. \n\n## Source of the website \n- We are using Quarto to create slides, with live code running in the background. You can access the source for this website and our slides on this GitHub page [https://github.com/kvarada/FoS-Intro-to-ML-2025](https://github.com/kvarada/FoS-Intro-to-ML-2025)\n\n# Let's get started!
